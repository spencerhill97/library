# Library

This is a library project to build a personal library and collection of books that you have read or are currently reading. You can delete, add, or mark books as read on this web app.

This project is pretty simple, but was one of the first projects that I built with constructors. Object Oriented Programming was daunting at first, but has now felt much more natural and practical to implement. This is a CRUD application as well although the data is not saved in a DB or local storage.
